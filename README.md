Originally: Plan to make a simple program for myself to keep track of things I need to do inside of the terminal.

New Idea: Learn a new skill by incorporating a GUI using Custom Tkinter to create a simple to-do list program which will allow you to select
between 4 different profiles in order to organize your to-dos based off different subjects. Will probably fill them with profiles named as
Home, Work, Study, Fun. Not settled on the final profile name.
